# f-MOPSO-Div
This project presents the source codes of a new version of the multi-objective particle swarm optimizer named the Diversity-enhanced fuzzy multi-objective particle swarm optimization (f-MOPSO/Div) algorithm. This algorithm is an improved version of our recently proposed f-MOPSO algorithm that has presented a novel approach to handle multi-objectivity of the optimization problems. In the proposed algorithm, a new characteristic of the particles in the objective space, which we named the “extremity,” is also evaluated, along with the Pareto-dominance, to appoint proper guides for the particles in the search space. Three improvements are applied to the f-MOPSO to mitigate its shortcomings, generating f-MOPSO/Div: (1) selecting the global best solution based on the diversity of the extreme solutions, (2) impeding the particles to be trapped in the local optima using a mutation scheme based on the dynamic probability, and (3) removing the pre-optimization process.

The source codes are specifically written to solve the bi-objective minimization problems.
